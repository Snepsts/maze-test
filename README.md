## maze-test
#### By Michael Ranciglio

This is my self-implemented maze. It utilizes the Depth-First Search algorithm. I'm sure there's plenty of other C++ DFS mazes, but I wanted to write my own for my purposes.

The main purpose of this maze was originally just for my C++ game, but I like this maze so much I wanted to give it its own repository.
